# space_missions_sql_analysis

In this project I picked a random dataset of interest and I took my time to look it over a bit. 
I then started thinking of some warm up questions and attempted solutions for them when it seemed possible. 
With one thing leading to the other, I eventually ended up learning a way to combine window functions, subqueries, aggregated data, and a little bit of conditional logic to determine the year-over-year growth rate in the number of launches.
